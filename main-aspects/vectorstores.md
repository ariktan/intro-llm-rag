# What Are Vector Databases?

In its most simplistic definition, a vector database stores information as vectors (vector embeddings), which are a numerical version of a data object.

As such, vector embeddings are a powerful method of indexing and searching across very large and unstructured or semi-unstructured  [datasets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/datasets/index.html). These datasets can consist of text, images, or sensor data and a vector database orders this information into a manageable format.

Vector databases work using high-dimensional vectors which can contain hundreds of different dimensions, each linked to a specific property of a data object. Thus creating an unrivaled level of complexity.

Not to be confused with a vector index or a vector search library, a vector database is a complete management solution to store and filter metadata in a way that:

-   Is completely scalable
-   Can be easily backed up
-   Enables dynamic data changes
-   Provides a high level of security

## The Benefits of Using Open Source Vector Databases

Open source vector databases provide numerous benefits over licensed alternatives, such as:

-   They are a  **flexible solution**  that can be easily modified to suit specific needs, unlike licensed options which are typically designed for a particular project.
-   Open source vector databases are  **supported by a large community of developers**  who are ready to assist with any issues or provide advice on how projects could be improved.
-   An open-source solution is budget-friendly with  **no licensing fees, subscription fees, or any unexpected costs**  during the project.
-   Due to the transparent nature of open-source vector databases,  **developers can work more effectively**, understanding every component and how the database was built.
-   Open source products are  **constantly being improved and evolving with changes in technology**  as they are backed by active communities.
# Open Source Vector Databases Comparison: Chroma Vs. Milvus Vs. Weaviate

Now that we have an understanding of what a vector database is and the benefits of an open-source solution, let’s consider some of the most popular options on the market. We will focus on the strengths, features, and uses of Chroma, Milvus, and Weaviate, before moving on to a direct head-to-head comparison to determine the best option for your needs.

## 1. Chroma

**In summary, the choice between ChromaDB and Faiss depends on the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your application. If your primary concern is efficient color-based similarity search, ChromaDB might be more suitable. If you need a general-purpose library for similarity search on large-scale vector data, Faiss is a versatile and powerful option.**
